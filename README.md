## About Project
This is my first single player FPS project in Unity. 

The player spawns in the middle of the scene and enemies will spawn around the player. The time between spawn will decrease and number of enemies spawned will increase as time goes on. 

The easy enemies are slow and move directly towards the player. The more difficult enemies move towards the player at a faster speed, but move horizonally away from the direction the player is aiming.

The player and enemies have healthbars that will show their health throughout the game. There is a weapon switch feature and an aiming feature in the game as well.
